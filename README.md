# First React!

Instead doing it again and again, this biolerplate will help you setup React environment with ES6 babel Support.

```
> git clone git@github.com:codxse/first-react.git
> cd first-react

> npm start
```

All jsx(s) file organized in jsx directory.

## Install JS Linter

If you need linter, we have included eslint. Just npm install eslint as global and install the add-on/extension on your favorite text-editor. I personaly testing using VSCode.

```
> npm intall -g eslint
```
