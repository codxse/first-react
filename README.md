# READ FIRST

I am no longer maintaining this project, a far far better code and very well documenting (with testing to) was realised by facebook. Here the repo (Create React App)[https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app]

# First React!

Instead doing it again and again, this biolerplate will help you setup React environment with ES6 babel Support.

```
> git clone git@github.com:codxse/first-react.git
> cd first-react
> npm install
> npm start
```

All jsx(s) file organized in jsx directory.

## Install JS Linter

If you need linter, we have included eslint. Just npm install eslint as global and install the add-on/extension on your favorite text-editor. I personaly testing using VSCode.

```
> npm intall -g eslint
```
